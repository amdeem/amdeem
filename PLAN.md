Building an Autonomous Multicast Decentralized Extensible Earning Marketplace (AMDEEM) would require careful planning and execution. Here's a plan to get started:

1. Define the goals and scope of the project: Before you start building AMDEEM, you need to have a clear understanding of what you want to achieve with the platform. You should define the goals of the project, identify the target audience, and determine the scope of the platform.
2. Choose a blockchain platform: To build a decentralized platform like AMDEEM, you'll need to choose a blockchain platform that can support smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). Ethereum is one of the most popular blockchain platforms for building DApps, but other options like Binance Smart Chain, Polkadot, and Cardano are also worth considering.
3. Design the architecture: You'll need to design the architecture of the platform, including the user interface, smart contracts, and back-end infrastructure. You should also consider the security implications of the platform and implement measures to protect against potential attacks.
4. Develop the smart contracts: Smart contracts are the backbone of any decentralized platform, and they'll play a critical role in AMDEEM. You'll need to develop smart contracts that handle transactions, manage user data, and enforce the rules of the platform.
5. Build the front-end: Once the smart contracts are in place, you'll need to build the front-end of the platform. This includes designing the user interface and implementing the features that users will interact with.
6. Test and deploy: Before launching the platform, you'll need to thoroughly test it to ensure that it's functioning as intended. You should also perform security audits to identify any vulnerabilities and address them before launch.
7. Launch and market the platform: Once you've tested and deployed the platform, it's time to launch it to the public. You'll need to develop a marketing strategy to attract users to the platform, including social media campaigns, content marketing, and advertising.
8. Monitor and update: After launching the platform, you'll need to monitor its performance and address any issues that arise. You should also plan to update the platform with new features and improvements over time to keep it relevant and competitive.

Building a platform like AMDEEM is a complex undertaking that requires a high level of technical expertise and careful planning. However, if executed successfully, it has the potential to revolutionize the way people earn and transact online.
